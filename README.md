## Computer Graphics Learning Studio

An interactive web-based application for learning computer graphics concepts. This project uses Three.js to create a 3D environment where users can explore and understand fundamental graphics concepts like the rendering pipeline, lighting models, texturing, and geometry.

### Features (Planned)
- Interactive 3D environment
- Educational content on graphics concepts
- Visual demonstrations of key principles
- User-controlled camera and scene manipulation

### Technologies
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D rendering

### Setup
